Smith' OR 1=1 OR last_name='Smith

The above line results in the following SQL command to be executed:

SELECT * FROM user_data WHERE last_name = 'Smith' OR 1=1 OR last_name='Smith';

This exploit takes advantage of the lack of form input sanitisation to insert an always true statement into the select command, causing all table entries to be retrieved.
